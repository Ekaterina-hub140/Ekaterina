Hello,
In this repository you will find: 

  2 games - BlackJack game (cards game) and a TicTacToe game

  Some algorythmic problems from Tinkoff bank (T-bank after rebranding) - the tasks 2025 Jan, 7 tasks with solutions. Got all OK status but again, the tests are only 1 per task, the solution is not 100% guaranteed correct (need at least 50 tests to ensure it works under all conditions) but I did what I could. 
  
  13 programs:

  1)Tile calculator - calculates how much tile is needed to cover a certain amount of floor(with an GUI element, 
  the program takes input from a user and can avoid mistakes with wrong input)
  
  2)Web scrapping program that searches for info and sends it in a email (you can put your email adress in a safe method and choose your recipient)
  
  3)Mortgage calculator - helps you understand how much you'll pay if you take a certain amount of money and choose a certain period of payment. 
  Can tell you how much is left to pay, how much money you'll have left from your income and etc. Has a help function
  
  4)This program writes down a simple file to count the general number of words, count the most common words and how often they are found in the text. 
  Then it extracts a zip file and searches for a phone number in all the files in the extracted folder

  5)web scraping program (books besteller finder) - it lets you choose your favourite books genre, looks for bestselling books in this genre at amazon.com page and gives ou a list of top 10, then suggests sending them to your email.

  6)web scraping program (again books but from litres this time). Had to use litres as sometimes there are troubles with amazon.com when you try to scrape it from Russia.

  7)Bank program. It is a Python program that utilizes the Tkinter library for creating a simple GUI. The program will ask the user whether they would like to take a mortgage or deposit money, allow them to input an amount and select a time period, then calculate and display the applicable interest rate based on the conditions specified by the user (the percent conditions are described in details in the program, start from a given point and change according to users choice).

 8)Minimum Spanning Tree - algorythmic problem. To solve it you need to Create a program which takes a connected, undirected graph with weights and outputs the minimum spanning tree of the graph i.e., a subgraph that is a tree, contains all the vertices, and the sum of its weights is the least possible.

 9)Eulerian Path. One more algorythmic problem, decided to train myself a bit in this field. The task is the following: create a program which will take as an input a graph and output either a Eulerian path or a Eulerian cycle, or state that it is not possible. A Eulerian Path starts at one node and traverses every edge of a graph through every node and finishes at another node. A Eulerian cycle is a eulerian Path that starts and finishes at the same node 

 10)Company Manager Program 
It's a Python program that implements an employee hierarchy using an abstract class and subclasses for different types of employees. The program includes a Company class that allows you to manage employees by hiring, firing, and raising their salaries. Created mostly to show usage of OOP in Python

11)Site Checker -  a Python program that implements a site checker with time scheduling. This program will attempt to connect to a specified website at regular intervals and notify you if the site is down. You can modify the email notification part to suit your needs. 

12)Inverted Index - it searches text files (docx and txt) for what the user needs to find in the text (case sensitive) An Inverted Index is a data structure used to create full text search. Given a set of text files, the program creates an inverted index. It has a simple user interface to do a search using that inverted index which returns a list of files that contain the query term / terms. 

13)Hotel booking -  simulates a hotel booking system for "The Best Inn". The program allows clients to book rooms, displays messages for available dates, and allows administrators to view all bookings. The bookings are saved to a directory created as a docx file with all the cofirmation dicx files stored in the same directory. The program suggest free dates if there are none for the selected period. There is a client\admin option with a password (WeHaveTheBestHotel). The admin can see all bookings made. 

For the site sample please, see my other repository (Blog-Django2)
