Hello,
In this repository you will find: 

  2 games - BlackJack game (cards game) and a TicTacToe game
  
  3 programs:

  1)Tile calculator - calculates how much tile is needed to cover a certain amount of floor(with an GUI element, 
  the program takes input from a user and can avoid mistakes with wrong input)
  
  2)Web scrapping program that searches for info and sends it in a email (you can put your email adress in a safe method and choose your recipient)
  
  3)Mortgage calculator - helps you understand how much you'll pay if you take a certain amount of money and choose a certain period of payment. 
  Can tell you how much is left to pay, how much money you'll have left from your income and etc. Has a help function
