    "Program \"Company Manager\"\n",
    "It's a Python program that implements an employee hierarchy using an abstract class and subclasses for different types of employees. The program includes a Company class that allows you to manage employees by hiring, firing, and raising their salaries.\n",
    "Short Explanation of what's happening below:\n",
    "Abstract Class Employee: This is the base class for all employee types. It defines an abstract method calculate_pay that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
    "Subclasses:\n",
    "HourlyEmployee: Represents employees paid by the hour. Pay is calculated based on hourly rate and hours worked.\n",
    "SalariedEmployee: Represents employees with a fixed annual salary. Pay is calculated as the annual salary divided by 12 for monthly pay.\n",
    "Manager: Inherits from SalariedEmployee and includes a bonus in the pay calculation.\n",
    "Executive: Inherits from Manager and includes stock options in the pay calculation.\n",
    "Company Class: Manages a list of employees. It has methods to hire, fire, raise salaries, and calculate total payroll.\n",
    "Main Function: Creates a Company instance, hires employees, calculates payroll, raises salaries, and fires an employee."
