    "Below is a Python program that simulates a hotel booking system for \"The Best Inn\". The program allows clients to book rooms, displays messages for available dates, and allows administrators to view all bookings.\n",
    "This program requires the python-docx package to create a Word document for booking confirmations. Install it using: pip install python-docx\n",
    "Explanation of the Program: \n",
    "Data Structure: The program uses a dictionary to keep track of room availability and bookings.\n",
    "Client and Admin Options: Users can choose between being a client or an administrator. Clients can book rooms, while administrators can view all bookings.\n",
    "Checking Availability: The program verifies if there are free rooms and finds nearby dates if the selected dates are fully booked.\n",
    "Booking Confirmation: Upon successful booking, a confirmation document is generated and saved.\n",
    "Password Protection for Admin: The admin section requires a password. After three failed attempts, it returns to the main menu.\n",
    "Loading Bookings: The load_bookings method reads the existing bookings from a \"bookings.docx\" file in the \"mybooking\" directory at the program's start.\n",
    "Saving Bookings: The save_booking method appends new bookings to the same \"bookings.docx\" file whenever a new reservation is created.\n",
    "Directory Creation: A check is added to create the \"mybooking\" directory if it does not already exist.\n",
    "Confirmation Document: Upon successful booking, a confirmation document is still created as before.\n",
    "Directory Structure:\n",
    "When you run this program, it will create a folder named \"mybooking\" in the same directory as the script. In this folder, you'll find the \"bookings.docx\" file containing information about bookings and individual confirmation files for each booking.\n",
    "Running the Program:\n",
    "Make sure you have the python-docx package installed and run the program. \n",
    "Input your desired booking options, and the program will handle storing and displaying booking information as specified!\n",
    "When you run the program again, it will retain the previously made bookings.\n"
